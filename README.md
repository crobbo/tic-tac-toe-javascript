Having completed a lesson on Constructors, Factory Fucntions and Immediately Invoked Function Expressions - I had to complete this mini project incorporating these code design patterns. 

For this project I create used Factory Fucntions and Immediately Invoked Function Expressions, SPlitting my code into modules (Gameboard, DisplayController) and Factory Functions (Players). 

For the UI I kept it simple - using CSS Grid for the Game Board and Flex Box for the general layout.
